# ClaudeVoice Fixed - Summary of Changes

## Problem
ClaudeVoice was reading garbage text making it completely unusable:
- Garbage patterns: "99", "2k1a", "1a2k", "1004l", "?1004"
- Duplicate messages (same content spoken 4 times)
- Tool messages like "Update Todos" being spoken
- Approval prompts causing issues

## Solution
Based on analysis of real debug logs from a full project session, the fixed version includes:

### 1. Duplicate Prevention
- Map-based tracking of recently spoken content
- 5-second window to prevent re-speaking
- Substring matching to catch partial duplicates

### 2. Enhanced Filtering
- Comprehensive SKIP_PATTERNS array for tool messages
- Filters out: "Update Todos", "Using the X tool", "Let me run", etc.
- Prevents speaking of file operations and status messages

### 3. Approval Context Handling
- Detects approval prompts and enters special context
- Skips numbered options (1. Yes, 2. No)
- Filters control sequence remnants during approval
- 10-second timeout for approval context

### 4. Aggressive Terminal Cleaning
- Strips ANSI CSI sequences
- Removes OSC and other escape sequences
- Filters control characters
- Removes bracket sequences

### 5. Plan/Compact Mode Handling
- Clears spoken history when entering these modes
- Prevents re-speaking of content

## Key Discoveries from Debug Analysis
1. Garbage patterns appear within escape sequences, not as standalone text
2. Duplicate messages were caused by terminal redraws
3. Tool messages were leaking through previous filters
4. Approval prompts are followed by specific control sequences

## Testing
The fixed version has been tested to ensure:
- No garbage text is spoken
- Messages are only spoken once
- Tool operations remain silent
- Approval prompts don't cause issues

## Installation
```bash
./install-fixed.sh
sudo cp claudevoice /usr/local/bin/
```

Or use the local version:
```bash
./claudevoice "your prompt here"
```
